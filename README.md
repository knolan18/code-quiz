## Code Quiz

A dynamic quiz about JavaScript facts has been created. A welcome screen prompts the user to begin the quiz by pushing the START! button, which loads the questions screen. This also prompts the timer to start at 60 seconds. A question appears on the screen with 4 answers, and the user must pick one of the answers. A correct answer will show green, and wrong answers will show red once an answer is clicked. If the user runs out of time, an alert window will appear informing the user that they are out of time. At the end of the quiz, the user is prompted to enter their name and score for a high scores board.
